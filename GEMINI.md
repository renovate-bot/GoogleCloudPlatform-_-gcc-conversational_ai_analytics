# AI Operating Manual for the GCC Conversational AI Analytics Repository

## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and application code for the Google Cloud Conversational AI Analytics project. It uses Terraform to provision and manage a suite of tools and services for analyzing and evaluating conversational AI agents built on Dialogflow CX.

The primary goal of this repository is to provide a set of reusable modules for:
- Extracting and storing Dialogflow CX agent structure.
- Running and managing CX test cases.
- Performing NLU testing.
- Incrementally exporting conversation data to BigQuery.
- Managing Dataform repositories for data transformation.

## 2. Core Technologies

* **Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
* **IaC:** Terraform
* **Data Warehousing:** BigQuery
* **Data Processing:** Cloud Functions (Python)
* **Data Transformation:** Dataform
* **Scheduling:** Cloud Scheduler
* **Messaging:** Pub/Sub

## 3. Repository Structure Overview

* `/modules/`: Contains reusable Terraform modules for provisioning various components of the analytics solution.

* `/dataform/`: Contains Dataorm blocks for transforming the data.

## 4. Development Workflow

When making any changes to this repository, you MUST follow this workflow:

1.  **Terraform Validation:** Before applying any changes, you MUST run `terraform validate` and `terraform plan` to ensure your configuration is valid and to review the planned changes.
2.  **Python Testing:** If you modify any Python code, you MUST run the corresponding `pytest` tests to ensure that your changes have not broken any existing functionality.
3.  **Update Documentation:** If your changes affect the behavior of a module or environment, you MUST update the corresponding `README.md` file to reflect these changes.

## 5. Terraform Modules Overview

### 5.1. `agent-structure`

This module provisions a Cloud Function that is triggered by a Cloud Logging sink. The sink is configured to detect when a Dialogflow CX agent is restored. When triggered, the Cloud Function extracts the agent's structure and saves it to a set of BigQuery tables.

**Key Components:**
- Gen2 Cloud Function (`agent-structure`)
- Pub/Sub topic (`trigger_agent_structure`)
- Cloud Logging sink
- BigQuery dataset and tables

### 5.2. `cx-test-cases`

This module provisions a Cloud Function that runs Dialogflow CX test cases on a schedule. The schedule is defined by a Cloud Scheduler job, which triggers the Cloud Function via an HTTP request. The results of the test cases are written to a BigQuery table.

**Key Components:**
- Gen2 Cloud Function (`cx-test-cases`)
- Cloud Scheduler jobs
- BigQuery table

### 5.3. `dataform`

This module provisions a Dataform repository and connects it to a remote Git repository. It also configures release schedules and compilation overrides, allowing you to manage your data transformation workflows as code.

**Key Components:**
- Dataform repository
- Secret Manager secret for Git authentication
- Dataform release configurations

### 5.4. `export-to-bq-incremental`

This module provisions a Cloud Function that incrementally exports conversation data from CCAI Insights to BigQuery. The function is triggered by a Cloud Scheduler job and uses a staging table to merge new and updated conversations into a final BigQuery table.

**Key Components:**
- Gen2 Cloud Function
- Cloud Scheduler job
- BigQuery tables (staging and final)

### 5.5. `nlu-testing`

This module provisions a Cloud Function that performs NLU testing on a Dialogflow CX agent. The function is triggered by a Cloud Scheduler job and uses a test configuration file from a GCS bucket. The results of the NLU tests are written to a BigQuery table.

**Key Components:**
- Gen2 Cloud Function (`nlu-testing`)
- Cloud Scheduler jobs
- BigQuery table

### 5.6. `conversation-generator`

This module deploys a 2nd Generation Cloud Function that simulates user conversations with a Dialogflow CX agent using Gemini. It is triggered by a Pub/Sub message, which can be sent manually for testing or automatically by a Cloud Scheduler job.

**Key Components:**
- Gen2 Cloud Function (`dfcx-simulator`)
- Pub/Sub topic (`dfcx-simulation-trigger`)
- Cloud Scheduler job

## 6. Key Commands

### Terraform Workflow

When performing any Terraform-related tasks, you MUST follow this exact sequence of commands from within an environment directory (e.g., `/environments/conversational-analytics-dev`).

1.  **Initialize the Backend:**
    This command configures Terraform to use the correct remote state file for the environment. You must check the backend.tf to ensure a bucket is specified. If not, ask the user to provide the bucket and add to terraform init (e.g., -backend-config="bucket=specified-bucket-name")
    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

2.  **Validate Terraform:**
    This command checks for configuration syntax errors and internal consistency. It is a crucial step to ensure your code is valid before planning or applying changes.
    ```bash
    terraform validate
    ```

3.  **Format Terraform:**
    This command ensure Terraform is consistently formatted.
    ```bash
    terraform fmt -recursive
    ```

4.  **Generate an Execution Plan:**
    This command shows you what changes will be made without applying them. It is a critical step to review the potential impact of your changes before applying them.
    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5.  **Apply Changes:**
    After the plan is reviewed and approved, apply the changes.
    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

## 7. Python Standards & Testing

### Environment Setup

All Python development for Cloud Functions MUST be done within a virtual environment to ensure dependency isolation. Each function directory (e.g., `/modules/agent-structure/cf-source-code/`) should be treated as a separate project.

You MUST use the following workflow:

1.  **Navigate to Function Directory**: `cd modules/<module-name>/<cf-source-code-dir>`
2.  **Create Virtual Environment**: `python3 -m venv .venv`
3.  **Activate Environment**: `source .venv/bin/activate`
4.  **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Running Tests

This project uses `pytest` for unit testing. Tests are located in `test_main.py` files within each function's directory.

To run the tests for a specific function, you MUST first activate its virtual environment and then run pytest:

```bash
# Navigate to the function's directory
cd modules/agent-structure/cf-source-code

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Run the tests
pytest
```

You MUST run these tests for any function you modify before submitting changes. This is a critical step to ensure that your changes have not introduced any regressions.
